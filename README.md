# -CSE-578-Data-Visualization
this repo is about the projects I made in the data visualization course during my master's degree at Arizona state univeristy

# what I have learned during developing this project ?

● Develop exploratory data analysis and visualization tools using Python and Jupyter notebooks <br />
● Apply design principles for a variety of statistical graphics and visualizations including scatterplots, line charts, histograms, and choropleth maps  <br />
● Combine exploratory queries, graphics, and interaction to develop functional tools for exploratory data analysis and visualization <br />

# prerequisite to run the code:
You will need following libraries installed in your machine: <br />

● Python 3.0 or higher <br />
● Numpy <br />
● Matplotlib <br />
● Pandas <br />
● sqlite3 <br />

# easy wasy to run the code online:
there is a easier way was to run and experiment the code by using online free jupyter notebook, you can use it for free from this link
https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/

just upload the  file that has extention .ipynb such as Assignment1.ipynb and upload the "dinofunworld.db" to jupyter notebook website and run the code as presented in the following screenshot:

# how run the code - example:

# how to install jupyter lab notebook locally on my computer ? <br />
you can install jupyter notebook by following the instructions in this link 
https://jupyter.org/install
 <br />
## here is an screenshot of after install jupyter lab locall on my computer:  <br />

# note:
make sure that the database file "dinofunworld.db" is in the same folder/directory of the code so that the python program read the database file. also check the database path in the python code in each assignment.
